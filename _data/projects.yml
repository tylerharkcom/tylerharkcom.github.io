    I started this project as a hands-on way to learning <mark>Python</mark> and has since turned into a fully fledged web app.
    When COVID-19 halted the NBA season, NBASim encountered some bugs that I haven't gotten around to fixing yet.

    Streats began as an idea in UCF's Founders Academy, an extracurricular program tailored for engineering & computer science students looking to gain entrepreneurial skills.
    My two co-founders and I went on to win the in-class venture competition, became semi-finalists for [UCF's Joust New Venture Competition](https://cel.ucf.edu/events/the-joust-new-venture-competition/), and pitched our business model to executives at the [Florida IT Pathways Symposium](https://flit-path.org/).
    As of August 2020, we are hard at work developing the first generation of Streats, aiming for a version 1.0 launch in April 2021.
